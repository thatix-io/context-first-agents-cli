# Pull Request Preparation

This command validates that everything is ready to create Pull Requests.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Complete implementation (all tasks from `/plan` executed)
- All commits made
- Clean and organized workspace

## Configuration

Read `context-manifest.json` and `ai.properties.md` from the orchestrator to get repositories, base_path, and task_management_system.

## 🎯 Objective

Ensure that the implementation is complete, tested, and ready for review before creating PRs.

## 🛑 CRITICAL: WHERE TO WORK

**⚠️ ATTENTION: ALL CODE (tests, fixes, adjustments) MUST BE CREATED INSIDE THE WORKTREE!**

**✅ CORRECT** - Work inside the worktree:
```
<orchestrator>/.sessions/<ISSUE-ID>/<repo-name>/src/file.ts  ✅
<orchestrator>/.sessions/<ISSUE-ID>/<repo-name>/tests/test.ts  ✅
<orchestrator>/.sessions/<ISSUE-ID>/<repo-name>/.eslintrc.js  ✅
```

**❌ WRONG** - NEVER create code outside the worktree:
```
<orchestrator>/.sessions/test.ts  ❌
<orchestrator>/.sessions/<ISSUE-ID>/test.ts  ❌
{base_path}/<repo-name>/test.ts  ❌ (main repository!)
```

**ABSOLUTE RULE**:
- 🛑 **ALL code** (tests, fixes, configurations) **MUST be in** `<orchestrator>/.sessions/<ISSUE-ID>/<repo-name>/`
- 🛑 **NEVER modify** the main repository in `{base_path}/<repo-name>/`
- ✅ **Work ONLY** inside the worktree of the specific repository

## ✅ Validation Checklist
